# Middle East mod hoi4
 
I'm working on an up-to-date working Middle East mod for hoi4. Uploaded it to GitHub so it'll be easier for me to work, and also maybe people would be interested in helping. It's been a while since I've worked on this and I probably won't finish any time soon. Any modder can use this for whatever you want however you want, as long as you're not just uploading it as your own mod. It was originally an Israel-only mod but I've decided to change it to the whole Middle East.

If you'd like to help hit me up on Discord @blagai
